            Jurassic Park is a 1993 American science fiction adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg and written
            by Michael Crichton and David Koepp, based on Crichton's 1990 novel. Starring Sam Neill, Laura Dern,
            Jeff Goldblum, and Richard Attenborough, the film is set on the fictional island of Isla Nublar near
            Costa Rica, where wealthy businessman John Hammond and a team of genetic scientists have created a
            wildlife park of de-extinct dinosaurs. When industrial sabotage leads to a catastrophic shutdown of the
            park's power and security systems, a small group of visitors struggle to survive and escape from the
            now-dangerous island.

            Before the novel was published, four major studios bid for the film rights. Universal Pictures and
            Spielberg won the rights for $1.5 million, and Crichton was paid an additional $500,000 to adapt the
            screenplay. Koepp wrote the final script, removing much of the novel's violence while altering several
            characters. Filming took place in California and Hawaii in 1992, featuring groundbreaking CGI by
            Industrial Light & Magic and animatronic dinosaurs built by Stan Winston's team.

            Jurassic Park premiered on June 9, 1993, and became the highest-grossing film of all time at its release,
            surpassing E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. It received widespread acclaim for its special effects, sound
            design, action sequences, Williams's musical score, and Spielberg's direction. After its 2013 20th
            anniversary re-release, the film surpassed $1 billion in box office revenue and remains regarded as one
            of the greatest blockbuster films ever made.
